# ApartmentUnitApp


This is bare-bones apartment search app created in Python. The program takes in apartment data from a text file in a space separated 
format. Through custom class modules, the app creates two databases for storing apartment and tenant information. The app also takes in user data to do the following:  

<ol>
<li>Rent/Lease Apartment</li>
<li>Search Available Apartments</li>
<li>Make Apartment Available</li>
<li>List Available Apartments</li>
<li>List Rented Apartments</li>
<li>Display Tenant Information</li>
<li>Add New Apartment</li>
<li>Exit</li>
</ol>
